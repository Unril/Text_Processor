This is the *Text Processor* project I made myself.


<p>In our everyday life, we work with data, they are all in different formats. One of the most known types of data is text. Sometimes we need to get some statistics about the texts we read, or we generate some data in text format, and we want it to be nicely formatted to be easy to read for others.
